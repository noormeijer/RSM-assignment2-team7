## Some rudimentary analysis in Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button in RStudio,a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

You can also **knit** the document from the command line, see the example in the `makefile`.


### Summary statistics

```{r}
summary(dt)
```

### Plots


```{r}
#Negative score for each period
ggplot(dt, aes( x= negative_score, color = period )) +
  geom_line(stat = "count") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "sentiment score", limits = c(0,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total", limits = c(0,20)) +
  ggtitle("Negative score sentiment during the 3 time slots")

```

```{r}
#Positve score for each period
ggplot(dt, aes( x= positive_score, color = period )) +
  geom_line(stat = "count") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "sentiment score", limits = c(0,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total", limits = c(0,25)) +
  ggtitle("Positive score sentiment during the 3 time slots")

```

```{r}
#Neutral score for each period
ggplot(dt, aes( x= neutral_score, color = period )) +
  geom_line(stat = "count") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "sentiment score", limits = c(0,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total", limits = c(0,45)) +
  ggtitle("Neutral score sentiment during the 3 time slots")
```


```{r}
